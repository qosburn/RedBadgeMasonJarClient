# Mason Jar Store

The site is developed for the exposure and ordering for Mason Jar designs products. Site will ultimately offer a wide range of woodworking and general art products. A majority of the products eventually will be one-off projects that will be specifically redesigned at the client's request. Mason Jar Design will utilize a collaborative approach which will offer a number of products that can be mass produced but still have "human touch". The site will offer exposure current offerings, future projects and over all design capabilities.
